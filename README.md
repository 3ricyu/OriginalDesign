Original Design
===============

In this assignment you will create a design of your own choosing. You may find the PowerPoint slides 1 to 128 of the [apjava1.pptx](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz2ZkT6qWPYTVkF4Q19aZ3dfdk0) presentation helpful. Your program should use a variety of the [Processing graphics functions](https://processing.org/reference/). You will also define four functions:  
`void setup()`  
`void draw()`  
and at least two of your own. Scroll down to see links to samples of other students submissions for this assignment. Have fun and be creative! Your design doesn't have to look like anyone else's.

Posting your finished program to GitHub
=======================================
When you are finished, follow the instructions for either the [basic](https://github.com/APCSLowell/SampleAssignmentSimple) or [advanced workflow](https://github.com/APCSLowell/SampleAssignment) to post your program to GitHub. Start by logging into GitHub and forking [this](https://github.com/LowellSampleClass/OriginalDesign) repository.  

Now, replace the Java code in the `OriginalDesign.pde` file with the code for your own design. You will also need to modify `index.html` to personalize the title, headline and footer. Once you are happy with your program, `add`, `commit` and `push` your work to GitHub. Submit the link to your finished program to google classroom.
